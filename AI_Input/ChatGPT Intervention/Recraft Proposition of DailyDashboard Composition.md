# Human Initial Prompt:
Alright, you have access to the kinda of data we have
note the manager we are setting all theese automation might not have the knowledge to analyze in detail these and will most likely focus on whether those people deserve extra money or not
Based on that, I need you to give me element that will be in my dashboard (pretend Daily Dashboard doesnt exist and we are redoing it) for the daily, weekly, monthly dasboard.

In fact they are pratical applications for the forms and the dashboard as mentioned in quote below. However, when the client contacted me it was to get a customer feedback system using Google Forms to collect few qualitative infomation, ratings and comments about sales representatives who are providing helping services to CASAMANCE customers (prescriptors, interior designers, atellier designers) about CASAMANCE textile product and other productss. He mentioned he wanted us to come up with something at the end of that like a reward system for representatives who achieve certain 5-star rating milestones (10, 15, or 20 five-star ratings earn rewards of 500, 750, and 1000 pounds respectively), which I wonder now since there is average rating in my code (for previously abandoned daily dashboard, in the KPI average rating and as well table rating giving average per rep but also sum of 5 star ratings)
"""
Customer retention - Quick response to negative feedback can turn unhappy customers into loyal ones
Team improvement - Identifying specific issues helps target training efforts
Recognition - Highlighting top performers boosts morale and encourages excellence
Trend identification - The weekly and monthly views help spot patterns that might not be visible day-to-day
"""

PSS: Thinnk of soemything relevsant either tables, list, KPI blocks, charts (of any type) and/OR anything you might deem necessary.

Please provide what should be in the dailyu dashboard first then I'll say 'continue' and you will provide the Weekly dashboard then I'll say 'continue' and you will provide the monthly dashboard


# ChatGPT Response:

**Designing dashboard elements**

I need to create a daily dashboard for a manager who may not have deep analytical knowledge. The purpose is to help them decide how much to reward reps for reaching milestones of 5-star ratings (10, 15, and 20). I’ll include data from form results and structure the dashboard to highlight important KPIs, tables, and charts. The goal is to make it simple and clear, so the manager can make informed decisions right away. Let's organize these components thoughtfully!

### Daily Customer-Feedback Dashboard (for managers at-a-glance)

| 📊 **Section**                    | 🗝️ **Why it matters**         | 💡 **What it shows / How it looks**                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Top-line KPIs (hero tiles)** | Instant grasp of day’s health  | • **Submissions today** (count)<br>• **Overall avg rating** (1-5, shown as gauge)<br>• **# 5-star ratings** (count + ∆ vs yesterday)<br>• **% negative cases** (“No” anywhere OR ≤2 stars)                              |
| **2. Rep Performance Table**      | Decide bonuses & coaching      | Columns:<br>Rep name · # responses · Avg rating · 5★ count (today / YTD) · Milestone reached? (10/15/20) · # negatives<br>Conditional formatting:<br>• green = ≥4.5 avg rating<br>• yellow = 3-4.49<br>• red < 3        |
| **3. Milestone Alert Panel**      | Reward trigger                 | Card list showing reps who **crossed 10 / 15 / 20** cumulative 5-star marks **today** with the payout amount (500 / 750 / 1000 GBP).                                                                                    |
| **4. Negative-Feedback Queue**    | Customer-retention action list | Filtered table of today’s submissions where:<br>• Any “No” answer **OR** ≤ 2-star rating.<br>Shows Email, Rep, Issue type (“Needs unmet”, “Presentation”, “Product”), Comment excerpt, Timestamp, **Follow-up status**. |
| **5. Rating Distribution Chart**  | Spot anomalies                 | Horizontal bar (1-bar per star level) or pie-chart of today’s rating spread. Quick visual of skew toward highs or lows.                                                                                                 |
| **6. Heat-Map by Hour**           | Staffing insight               | 24-column heat-map: darker = more submissions. Helps see peaks & overlaps; manager can tweak staffing or call-back windows.                                                                                             |
| **7. Rolling 7-day Sparkline**    | Micro-trend context            | Tiny line chart of daily average rating vs previous 6 days (grey) with today (blue) highlighted. Keeps trend front-of-mind without leaving daily view.                                                                  |

#### UX notes

* All numbers clickable to drill into raw rows (for the data-savvy manager later).
* Negative queue table has a **“Mark as resolved”** checkbox so issues drop off next reload.
* Milestone cards auto-expire next day (still visible in weekly view).

Let me know when you’re ready—say **“continue”** and I’ll lay out the Weekly dashboard.
