# USER PROMPT BEFORE AI GO CONFUSED ON HEADER WIDTH & LAYOUT

Okay it worked but I have three group of issues now (as per screenshots)

• Group1:  the KPI tiles area you may see in 'Screenshot 20250510 at 4.44.53 PM.png' then see, after zooming in 'Screenshot 20250510 at 4.43.34 PM.png'
> Perhaps in redoing the module logic you forgot (you did Layout and table module in an alternate verison of this conversation) the way we did treat the titles and how each content appear (if needed you might visually search and confirm issues against previously working KPI tiles screenshot 'DailyDash1_@Moving▼XDisplays[SUCCESS].png')
-Issue with tile number of rows thus tile container structure. Too many 7 and 8 shouldnt be part (it is really as if we are back to initial code lol)
-Issue with tile container element forgot and now reflecting initial; not lastly working (attached 'DailyDash1_@Moving▼XDisplays[SUCCESS].png')

•Group2: The Representatives Performance table you may see in 'Screenshot 20250510 at 4.44.53 PM.png'; then see, after scrolling through the sheet and zooming in 'Screenshot 20250510 at 4.44.20 PM.png'
> We should probably find a better way to deal with tabe columns widths. the title are too restricitve so is the 30 width in-btw-tiles. However, if we add in column a new world is opening for both the tile and the table. Let me make it clear with an example of logic you will ameliorate & adapt:

1. We add 2 columns (or more) in first KPI tile before the in between title columns, then subsequently till the last KPI tiles 2 columns (or more) in second to the last KPI tile before the in between title column.
2. We add columns in each tile with so that set width and width ration of merged two cells dont change for each tiles so have the same feel as prior (regardless of the number of actuall columns)
3. We add columns so that the table headers width would be made of merged cells allowing different cells merged ration while the table will have the same width ration as all the table. You will correct this part noting in 'Screenshot 20250510 at 5.17.43 PM.png' the relative widths and positionings of the tables headers as compared to the KPI tiles (as this should be visually close to the mockup)

• Group3: The space at row 11 and 12 btw KPI tiles and table you may see in 'Screenshot 20250510 at 4.44.53 PM.png' then see, after scrolling through the sheet and zooming in'Screenshot 20250510 at 4.44.02 PM.png'
-Issue of white space instead of background colour when I made change to the code
>As if background colour I currently have in my sheet outside of the non affected area (tiles and table) was set manually instead of set in the layout code

## We are back to providing not full code but portions needed

## Thoroughly answer and provide one prompt to each group. I will say 'CONTINUE' for you to provide the rest. you will attend to groups in this sequent 1 --> 2 --> 3

Find attached as well the code you create  (for context) in the alternative version of this conversaiton.
