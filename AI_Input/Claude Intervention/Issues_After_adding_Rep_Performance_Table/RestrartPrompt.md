# **Context Summary for New Conversation:**

## Project Overview

Creating the CASAMANCE Daily Dashboard in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script. The dashboard tracks customer service performance metrics with real-time data from Google Forms.

## Background

- Working from an SVG mockup design
- Data source: Google Forms with headers "Timestamp | Email Address | Who attended to you needs? | Has your need been met? | Were you satisfied with the Rep's presentation? | How would you rate our services on a scale of 1 to 5 stars?"
- Already have working modules: Headers, DashboardConfig, Module Controller

## Current Goal

Implementing the Representative Performance table section that sits below KPI tiles on the dashboard.

## What We've Built So Far

1. **KPI Tiles**: 4 tiles (Submissions Today, Average Rating, 5-Star Ratings, % Negative Cases)
   - Originally worked with proper formatting
   - Used column pattern: 1, 4, 7, 10 for tile starts
   - Each tile: 2 columns wide (main value + change indicator)
   - 30px spacer columns between tiles

2. **Additional Modules Created**:
   - DailyDash_New [DataProcessing].js - Aggregates form data
   - DailyDash_New [Tables].js - Creates performance table
   - Updated LayoutUtils and KPI Titles modules

3. **All Modules**
   - DailyDash_New [Headers].js
   - DailyDash_New [DashboardConfig].js
   - DailyDash_New [ModuleController].js
   - DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js
   - DailyDash_New [KPITiles].js
   - DailyDash_New [DataProcessing].js
   - DailyDash_New [Tables].js
   - DailyDash_New [Utilities].js {Not Created Yet}
   - DailyDash_New [StyleConfig].js {Not Created Yet}
   - DailyDash_New [ChartConfig].js {Not Created Yet}

## Current Issues

1. **KPI Tiles Problems** (after recent changes):
   - Lost merged cells in titles/subtitles
   - 5-star rating change indicator not showing
   - Tiles reverted to earlier non-working state
   - Extra rows appearing (rows 7-8)

2. **Table Width Issues**:
   - Table needs to span same width as KPI tiles (A-K)
   - Headers too restrictive with current column widths
   - Need flexible column system that maintains KPI appearance

3. **Spacing Problems**:
   - White space between KPI tiles and table (rows 11-12)
   - Background color not applying correctly

## What We Tried (That Didn't Work)

1. Reduced KPI tiles from 7 to 5 rows - caused merged cell issues
2. Modified formatKpiValueWithChange function - broke 5-star indicator
3. Attempted flexible grid system - caused regression in KPI formatting

## Technical Requirements

- KPI tiles: Max width 230px, split 38%/62% between cells
- Table must align with KPI tiles width
- Maintain original working column widths (110px/120px)
- Need system that allows more columns while preserving visual layout

## Files to Include in New Conversation

1. Current code for all modules
2. SVG mockup screenshot
3. Screenshots showing working state vs. current broken state
4. Form data headers structure
