## User Prompt

Okay seems like we have to reset everything from scratch cause refactoring existing code seems ineffective.
Notice that in notes that visual cells  columns refer to cell or group of cells and column or group of columns that appear as one in a KPI container or other container. Thus if for example, you provided earlier first KPI has google sheet columns A to D passing through it, in that tile (only) And B form a visual column or cell where the KPI value is at and C and D the other visual column/cell on the right on the main figure of the KPI.

I wanna recreate modules (with even perhaps a better break down of module) from scratch the adaptive grid system and each container in a way that we will add containers from titles, to tiles to table and the detected google sheet grid will be readjusted so that each element layout would have some proper width layout rendering (then later, think about adding data to it).
See attached code that changed and the recap of the AI I worked with.

Let's discuss how we will achieve this. Map the importsant point

### Starting Fresh: Key Points for a Robust Dashboard Layout System

After reviewing the code, feedback documents, and screenshots, I understand that we need to start from scratch rather than continue refactoring. Here are the key points we should address in creating a new dashboard layout system:

#### 1. Core Problems with Current Approach

- **Visual vs. Sheet Columns Confusion**: Current code mixes "visual columns" (what appears as one unit) with actual Google Sheets columns
- **Inconsistent Merging Logic**: Cell merging isn't consistently applied across components
- **Rigid Positioning**: Fixed column positions make it difficult to add/modify components
- **Background Color Issues**: Containers should use dashboard background color, not white

#### 2. Band-Based Column Structure

I see you've already started implementing the band concept in `DASHBOARD_GRID`. This is a good approach, but needs refinement:

- **Band Definition**: Each band should be a logical group of columns with specific purpose
- **Mixed Column Counts**: Bands should support variable numbers of columns (1-3 columns per band)
- **Consistent Visual Width**: Similar visual elements should have identical total widths

#### 3. Module Structure Proposal

```markdown
1. GridSystem.js
   - DASHBOARD_GRID definition
   - setupGrid() function
   - getBandColumns() utility
   - visualizeGrid() for debugging

2. ContainerSystem.js
   - createContainer() - creates backgrounds, borders
   - createSectionHeader() - standardized headers
   - createTableContainer() - specialized for tables

3. Renderers/
   - KpiRenderer.js - renderKpi() functions
   - TableRenderer.js - renderTable() functions

4. Main modules (refactored)
   - DailyDash_New [KPI Tiles].js - uses renderers
   - DailyDash_New [TablesModule].js - uses renderers
```

#### 4. New Grid Structure Details

```javascript
const DASHBOARD_GRID = {
  // Visual bands (groups of 1-3 columns)
  bands: [
    {
      name: "band1",
      columns: ["A", "B", "C"],  // 3 actual columns per band
      widths: [90, 90, 50],      // Column widths
      totalWidth: 230            // Visual width (sum)
    },
    // Repeat for bands 2-4
  ],
  // Visual elements (KPI components)
  elements: {
    "kpi_title": { span: 3 },       // Title spans all 3 columns in a band
    "kpi_value": { span: 1 },       // Main value uses first column
    "kpi_secondary": { span: 2 },   // Secondary info uses 2nd & 3rd columns  
    "kpi_change": { span: 3 }       // Change indicator spans all 3 columns
  },
  // Table structure
  tableHeaders: [
    { name: "Rep Name", bands: ["band1"] },
    { name: "Performance", bands: ["band2"] },
    { name: "Milestone", bands: ["band3"] },
    { name: "Rewards", bands: ["band4"] }
  ],
  // Table subheaders (mapped to columns)
  tableColumns: [
    { name: "Rep Name", column: "A" },
    { name: "Responses", column: "D" },
    { name: "Rating", column: "E" },
    { name: "5â˜… Today", column: "F" },
    // Continue for all columns
  ]
}
```

#### 5. Container Creation Logic

Container functions would:

1. Calculate actual sheet column start/end from band names
2. Apply background color (dashboard background, not white)
3. Add borders
4. Return container info for renderers

```javascript
function createContainer(sheet, startRow, bandNames, numRows, options) {
  // Calculate actual columns from band names
  // Create range and format it
  // Return container info
}
```

#### 6. Content Rendering Approach

Renderer functions would:

1. Take container info and data
2. Format specific cells within the container
3. Apply proper merging based on element definitions

```javascript
function renderKpiTile(sheet, container, kpiData) {
  // Render title across all columns in band
  // Render value in first column
  // Render secondary info if needed
  // Render change indicator with proper formatting
}
```

#### 7. Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with GridSystem**: Define bands and elements
2. **Create ContainerSystem**: Build container functions
3. **Build Basic Renderers**: Implement KPI and table renderers
4. **Refactor Main Modules**: Update to use new system
5. **Test and Debug**: Verify visual alignment matches requirements

This fresh approach should give you the flexibility and consistency you need while maintaining the visual structure requirements shown in your screenshots.
