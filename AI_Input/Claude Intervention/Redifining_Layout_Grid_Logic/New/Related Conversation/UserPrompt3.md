# USer Prompt 3

So I keep the other 3 modules and add this one? Im a little confused I thought you'd simply make background colour of headrs and date tiles/elements white and remember later to do the same with KPI tiles. Is it a logic added to do that after creating each tiles/element? in this prompt you provided onlly one artifact (perhaps a glitch) without adjust to other codes modules which enhance my confusion.
DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE SPINET JUST RESPOND TO THE QUESTION.
