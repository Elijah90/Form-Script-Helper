Heya, I need to create KPI tiles using google App Script linked to the googel sheet im trying to have the visual in. Could you help me with that?

Im trying to redo the attached code (which are the code on the google script project but they have been uploaded as .js because of extension upload restrictions). I want to totally redo the logic (in current code) from scratch
I wanted to restart at 'answer 30.md' from cursor. I added some claude recommendations (new points). Now Im willing to start with the implementation however, I want to go to a slow pace for me to test each elements (headers with DASHBOARD tile, date then start wityh the KPI tiles and then later the talbe then ...) of the dashbaord as I build. I want to build layout and renderers empty of actual data processing so I can validate visually the results.
Let's start with the headers. Let's place it !
