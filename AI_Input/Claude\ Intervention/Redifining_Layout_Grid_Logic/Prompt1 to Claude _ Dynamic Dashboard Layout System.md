Okay you already have the codes provided earlier to you. Now let's move to thinking phase of the code rearrangement.

---

I want to go fast creating other section and reducing the risk of coming back to correct layout each time. Im not satisfied with current code structure nor some of the logic relating to these issues mentioned. I think to be able to have less issues as I move along I should have a dynamic google sheet column structure logic compound with a continaer logic which will automatically match the google sheet column logic structure. If I were to visuallize it, Id say the code set the columns on which the dashboard will appear (which columns and their width), then justapose the containers of KPI tiles or tables or chart on them with giving me the easy possibility of redefining (or using AI to calculate a best fit redefining) the number of columns roles (passing between KPI tiles as sperator or restricted within KPI for example), and width. Or think of moving bands being google sheet column which automatically move or/and resize or/and added (as new additional band) so that new element of the dashboard can be added if it need more band and existing might not be visually affected as each retain their width and the merged element remain merged while retaining their width as well.

Find attached for your use the two main guiders from GPT4.1:

* NiceAnwerFixMultipleIssue_SurroundingColumnLayoutLogicDisplay. I like this answer cause I really understood my issue here
* dashboard_kpi_refactoring_summary3(TraeBuilder_GPT4.1)

Find also attached some files 'NiceAnwerFixMultipleIssue_SurroundingColumnLayoutLogicDisplay' referring to for additional context:

* [dashboard_kpi_refactoring_summary(CursorBuilder).md](../../../GUIDES/AI%20Guidance%20Documentation/dashboard_kpi_refactoring_summary(CursorBuilder).md)
