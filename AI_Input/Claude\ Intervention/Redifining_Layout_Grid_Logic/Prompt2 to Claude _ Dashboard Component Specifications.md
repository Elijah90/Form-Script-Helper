Okay please provide some of the requirement of the KPI titles, width (in px/pts not sure of the unit nomenclature), what should be merged inside, what is rendered into visual cell (a google sheet cell or group of cells appearing as one because merged) witihn each titles. Same thing for the tables contents/structure
Just in case this is hard to retrieve find either in current code or guide docs, find attached screenshot of the mock up (helpful with tables relatively to KPI titles) and the actual of what I currently have (even tho, it might not be exactly the end result desired)
