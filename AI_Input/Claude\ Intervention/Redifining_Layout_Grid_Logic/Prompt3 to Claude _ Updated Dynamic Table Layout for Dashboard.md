Okay check the [mock up](../../../Visuals/Screenshots/Dashboard%20SVG%20Mock%20Up%20Screenshotted/Screenshot%2020250510%20at%205.17.43â€¯PM.png) (as well as attached screenshot of [table wrong state](../../../Visuals/Screenshots/New_DailyDashboard1/Adding_RepresentativePerformance/KPI_IssueResolved_NowTableLayoutandDisplayIssue/DailyDash1_@_IssueLayoutLogicDisplay_RepPerfomanceTable_AfterRefactoringLayout.png); note the current state which screenshot so prevoide earlier is also wrong as it misses some headers/columns) and according to the new dynamic layout logic we are trying to implement try to add some few columns so that we it doesnt just go on along with A-B, D-E ... to create issue for me but something more relevant according to the relative positioning in the mockup and tiles width, visual cells and other tiles strucutral requirement we have in the actual.
Refer to the mock up for complete/all headers elements.

Focus on tables and be careful of the headers text legth to ensure each headers span across the appropriate number of column (if just one or more) noting you may not resize a column width too much to accomodate the text length of a header
