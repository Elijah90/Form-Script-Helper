# Dashboard KPI Tiles Refactoring Summary

## Session 1: Initial 3-Row KPI Structure Implementation

### User Goal Summary:

The user reported that the KPI tiles display was not as desired. The goal was to refactor the KPI tiles to a compact 3-row structure per tile (Title, Value + Optional Secondary Info, Change Indicator Line) to match a target visual (`DailyDash1__Moving_▼__X__DisplaysSUCCESS.png` / `Screenshot 2025-05-11 at 9.30.54 AM.png`). This involved:

* Adjusting row heights for a 3-row tile.
* Relocating secondary information (like "(out of 5.0)" for Average Rating and "X% of total" for 5-Star Ratings) to the second cell of the value row.
* Displaying the change indicator (e.g., "▲ 50") alongside "vs. yesterday" in a merged cell on the third row, using RichText for dual coloring.
* Converting the "Action needed: X cases" subtitle for the "% Negative Cases" tile into a cell note on its change indicator line.

### AI Actions & Affected Module

### 1. DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js Modifications

#### `setKpiRowHeights` Function

* Updated to define heights for a 3-row KPI tile structure:
  * Title row (e.g., `startRow`): Height 25
  * Main value row (e.g., `startRow + 1`): Height 50
  * Change indicator/subtitle row (e.g., `startRow + 2`): Height 25

#### `formatKpiValueWithChange` Function

* Signature changed to include `tileTitle` and `tileSubtitle` parameters for more specific logic
* Value Row (`row` parameter, which is `startRow + 1` from caller):
  * Main KPI value placed in the first cell (`column`)
  * Secondary information for "Average Rating" (i.e., "(out of 5.0)") placed in the second cell (`column + 1`)
  * Secondary information for "5-Star Ratings" (using the passed `tileSubtitle` like "X% of total") placed in the second cell (`column + 1`)
* Change Indicator Row (`row + 1`, which is `startRow + 2` from caller):
  * Cell at `(row + 1, column)` merged across 2 columns
  * Combined text (e.g., "▲ 50 vs. yesterday") set with RichText for dual coloring (dynamic color for change, static color for " vs. yesterday")
  * For "% Negative Cases", the `tileSubtitle` (e.g., "Action needed: X cases") set as a cell note on this merged cell

### 2. `DailyDash_New [KPI Titles].js` Modifications

#### `createSimpleKPITile` Function

* `formatTile` call updated to format a 3-row container: `sheet.getRange(startRow, tileConfig.column, 3, 2)`
* Called the revamped `formatKpiValueWithChange` for the value row (`startRow + 1`), passing `tileConfig.title` and `tileConfig.subtitle` to enable the new layout logic
* The previous direct call to `formatKpiSubtitle` (which used to render subtitles on `startRow + 3`) was removed, as its content was integrated into `formatKpiValueWithChange`

#### `createKPITiles` Function

* `clearSectionArea` updated to clear 3 rows per KPI section
* `addSectionSpacing` call updated to `startRow + 2` (spacing after the 3rd row of the tile)
* Return value adjusted to `startRow + 3` (next available row after a 3-row KPI tile)

#### `createEmptyKPITiles` Function

* Similar adjustments for `clearSectionArea` and `addSectionSpacing` to align with the 3-row structure

## Session 2: Refinement and Troubleshooting of 3-Row KPI Structure

### User Goal Summary

The user reported that the changes from Session 1 resulted in a worse visual state ("State B" - `Screenshot 2025-05-11 at 9.22.55 AM.png`), where an unexpected 4th row of content (the original subtitles) appeared within the KPI tiles. The goal remained to achieve the desired 3-row compact structure ("State C" - `Screenshot 2025-05-11 at 9.30.54 AM.png`).

### AI Actions & Affected Modules

**1. Code Review & Diagnosis:**

* Re-read `DailyDash_New [KPI Titles].js` (specifically `createSimpleKPITile`) to confirm that the call to `formatKpiSubtitle` (which would have written to `startRow+3`) was indeed removed as intended. Confirmed it was removed. This suggested the issue was unlikely a simple rogue call in that function.

**2. `DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js` Modified (Further Refinement):**

* **`formatKpiValueWithChange` function:**
  * Added explicit `clearContent().clearDataValidations().clearNote()` calls for the main value cell and the secondary info cell on the value row before setting new content, ensuring a clean state
  * Changed `setVerticalAlignment("bottom")` to `setVerticalAlignment("middle")` for the secondary info text (e.g., "(out of 5.0)", "X% of total") to better align with the large KPI value, aiming to match the target screenshot (State C)
  * Ensured the secondary info cell (`row, column + 1`) is explicitly cleared if the tile is not "Average Rating" or "5-Star Ratings"
  * Ensured the cell note on the change indicator row (`row + 1, column`) is explicitly cleared if the tile is not "% Negative Cases"
  * The logic for clearing, unmerging, and re-merging the change indicator cell (`row + 1, column, 1, 2`) was re-verified to ensure it correctly targets and prepares the third row of the KPI tile

The overall aim of these refinements was to make the 3-row rendering more robust and address potential reasons for the visual discrepancies reported by the user, focusing on the precise formatting and clearing of cells within the intended 3-row structure.
