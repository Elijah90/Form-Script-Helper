Excellent! Hereâ€™s the **detailed plan for Group 1: Centralized Grid/Band System**â€”with a focus on making it easy to test and visualize before moving on.

# ðŸŸ¢ **Group 1: Centralized Grid/Band System**

## **Objective**
- Define all dashboard columns, bands, and spacers in one place.
- Set column widths programmatically.
- Provide a mapping (object) so all other modules can reference bands/columns by name, not hardcoded letters/numbers.
- Make it easy to visualize and verify the grid structure.

---

## **Step-by-Step Plan**

### 1. **Create a Grid Configuration Object**

- In a utility module (e.g., `LayoutUtils` or a new `GridSystem.js`), define a `DASHBOARD_GRID` object.
- Example structure (customize as needed):

```js
const DASHBOARD_GRID = {
  bands: [
    { name: "Band1", columns: ["A", "B", "C"], widths: [90, 90, 50] },
    { name: "Band2", columns: ["D", "E", "F"], widths: [70, 80, 80] },
    { name: "Band3", columns: ["G", "H", "I"], widths: [80, 100, 50] },
    { name: "Band4", columns: ["J", "K", "L"], widths: [120, 110, 30] }
  ],
  // Optionally, add controls or extra bands here
};
```

### 2. **Write a Function to Set Column Widths**

- Implement a function (e.g., `setupDashboardGrid(sheet)`) that:
  - Iterates through `DASHBOARD_GRID.bands`
  - Sets the width for each column
  - Returns a mapping of band names to column indices (for later use)

### 3. **(Optional) Add a Visual Debug Helper**

- For testing, add a function that colors each band differently (e.g., light blue, light green, etc.) so you can visually confirm the grid in the sheet.

### 4. **Test the Grid Setup**

- Run the grid setup function on your dashboard sheet.
- Visually confirm:
  - All columns are the correct width.
  - Bands and spacers are in the right place.
  - (If using the debug helper) Each band is colored as expected.

---

## **Deliverables for Group 1**

- `DASHBOARD_GRID` config object (in a utility module)
- `setupDashboardGrid(sheet)` function to set widths and return band mapping
- (Optional) `visualizeDashboardGrid(sheet)` function for coloring bands
- **Tested and visually confirmed grid structure**

---

## **Next Steps**

- Once you confirm the grid looks correct, weâ€™ll move to Group 2 (container system).

**Would you like a code outline for these functions, or do you want to try implementing and testing the grid setup first?**  
Let me know if you want the code outline or have any preferences for band names, widths, or the debug helper!
