Excellent! Now that your grid system is robust and visually clear, letâ€™s outline **Group 2: The Container System for Section Placement**.

# ðŸŸ¢ **Group 2: Container System Implementation Plan**

## **Goal**
Allow each dashboard section (KPI tile, table, chart, etc.) to declare which bands/columns and rows it occupies, and have the system handle merging, background, and borders automatically.  
This will make it easy to add, move, or resize dashboard elements without manual merge/format code everywhere.

---

## **What Weâ€™ll Build in Group 2**

### 1. **Container Definition & Creation**
- **A function** (e.g., `createContainer`) that:
  - Accepts:
    - The sheet
    - Start row
    - Number of rows
    - Band name(s) (e.g., `'band1'`, `['band2', 'spacer2', 'band3']`)
    - Optional: background color, border, title, etc.
  - Handles:
    - Merging the specified columns/rows into a single container
    - Setting background and border
    - Returning the range for content rendering

### 2. **Usage Example**
- Show how to create a container for:
  - A single KPI tile (e.g., 3 rows, band1)
  - The full-width table (e.g., 5 rows, all bands + spacers)

### 3. **Testing**
- Add a test function to create and

visualize a few containers (e.g., one for each KPI tile, one for the table) so you can see the merged areas and backgrounds in your sheet. This will let you confirm that the container logic works before integrating it with your actual dashboard content.

## **Step-by-Step for Group 2**

### **Step 1: Implement `createContainer` Function**
- Place this in your `LayoutUtils` module.
- Inputs:
  - `sheet`
  - `startRow`
  - `numRows`
  - `bands` (string or array of band names, e.g., `'band1'` or `['band2', 'spacer2', 'band3']`)
  - Optional: `options` (background color, border, title, etc.)
- Logic:
  - Look up the columns for each band from `DASHBOARD_GRID`.
  - Merge the full area (all columns in those bands, all specified rows).
  - Set background and border as requested.
  - Return the merged range (for content rendering).

### **Step 2: Add a Test Function**
- Example: Create four containers for KPI tiles (each in its own band, 3 rows), and one container for the table (spanning all bands, e.g., 5 rows).
- Visually confirm in the sheet that the containers are merged and formatted as expected.

### **Step 3: Document Usage**
- Add comments/examples showing how to use `createContainer` for any new dashboard section.

---

## **Checkpoint**
- Once you can create and see containers for KPI tiles and the table, and they align perfectly with your grid, **Group 2 is complete**.
- Youâ€™ll be ready to refactor your actual KPI and table code to use these containers in Group 3.

**Would you like to review the proposed function signature and test example before I write the code? Or should I proceed with the implementation as described?**
