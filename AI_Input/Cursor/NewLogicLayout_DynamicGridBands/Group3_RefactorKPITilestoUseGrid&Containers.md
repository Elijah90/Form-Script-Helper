Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown of **what weâ€™ll do in Group 3: Refactor KPI Tiles to Use Grid & Containers**:

# ðŸŸ¢ **Group 3: Refactor KPI Tiles to Use Grid & Containers**

## **Goal**
- Make each KPI tile (Submissions Today, Average Rating, 5-Star Ratings, % Negative Cases) use the new grid and container system for placement, merging, and formatting.
- Ensure all tiles are perfectly aligned, easy to adjust, and robust against future layout changes.

---

## **What Will Change?**

### 1. **Placement & Merging**
- **Current:**  
  KPI tiles are placed and merged using hardcoded column/row indices and manual merge logic.
- **New:**  
  Each tile will use `createContainer` to define its area (e.g., `['band1']`, `['band2']`, etc.), and the container will handle merging and background.

### 2. **Content Rendering**
- **Current:**  
  Content (title, value, change indicator) is written directly to cells, sometimes with repeated or inconsistent logic.
- **New:**  
  After creating the container, content will be rendered inside the merged area using a consistent, modular approach.

### 3. **Alignment & Spacing**
- **Current:**  
  Manual calculation of columns and spacers, which can break if you add/remove tiles or change widths.
- **New:**  
  All alignment is handled by the grid and container system, so adding/removing tiles or changing band widths is easy and safe.

### 4. **Extensibility**
- **Current:**  
  Adding a new KPI tile or changing the layout requires editing multiple places in the code.
- **New:**  
  You can add a new tile by adding a new band and calling `createContainer` with the new band name.

---

## **Step-by-Step Plan**

1. **Update the KPI tile creation logic** (in your KPI module):
   - For each tile, call `createContainer` with the appropriate band (e.g., `['band1']`, `['band2']`, etc.) and 3 rows.
   - Use the returned range/columns to render the title, value, and change indicator inside the container.

2. **Remove old manual merge/placement logic** for KPI tiles.

3. **Test:**  
   - Run the dashboard and confirm that all KPI tiles are perfectly aligned, merged, and spaced according to the grid.
   - Try changing a band width or adding a new tile to confirm the system is robust.

## **What Youâ€™ll Get**

- **Visually perfect, robust KPI tiles** that always align with the grid and are easy to adjust.
- **No more manual fixes** when you add/remove tiles or change the layout.
- **A foundation for refactoring the table and other sections in the same way.**
