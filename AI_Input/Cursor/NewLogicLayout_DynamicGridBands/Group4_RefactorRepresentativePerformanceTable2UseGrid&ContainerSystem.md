Great! Here’s a clear breakdown of **Group 4: Table Refactor**—what we’ll do, why, and how we’ll test it.

# 🟢 **Group 4: Refactor the Representative Performance Table to Use the Grid & Container System**

## **Goal**
- Make the **Representative Performance table** (headers, data rows, and section container) use the same robust, grid-driven, container-based layout as the KPI tiles.
- Ensure perfect alignment with the KPI tiles above, consistent merging, background, and border logic.
- Make it easy to add columns, adjust headers, or change layout in the future—no more manual fixes!

---

## **What We’ll Do**

### **1. Table Container**
- Use `createContainer` to define the table’s area (spanning all bands and spacers, e.g., `['band1','spacer1','band2','spacer2','band3','spacer3','band4']`).
- Set a white background and a light grey border for the table area.

### **2. Section Header**
- Use a merged range (across all bands) for the “Representative Performance” section header, as before, but ensure it’s aligned to the grid.

### **3. Table Headers**
- Refactor `createPerformanceTableHeaders` to:
  - Use the grid/band system for merging header cells.
  - Ensure each header (e.g., “Sales Rep”, “Performance Metrics”, etc.) is merged across the correct columns/bands.
  - Spacer columns remain unmerged and have the dashboard background.

### **4. Data Rows**
- Refactor `createPerformanceDataRows` to:
  - Use the grid/band system for merging and placing data cells.
  - Each data cell (e.g., rep name, metrics, progress, rewards/negatives) is merged/aligned to match the headers and KPI tiles.
  - Apply row background color based on performance, as before.

### **5. Visual Consistency**
- Ensure all backgrounds, borders, and spacers match the dashboard’s visual contract.
- No more “floating” or misaligned cells—everything lines up with the grid.

---

## **Testing/Checkpoints**

- Run the dashboard refresh and confirm:
  - The table aligns perfectly with the KPI tiles above.
  - Headers are readable, merged, and not squished.
  - Data rows are aligned and colored as expected.
  - Spacer columns are visually consistent.
- Try adding a new column or changing a header to confirm the system is robust.

## **Summary Table**

| Step                | What Changes                | Benefit                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Table container     | Uses grid & container      | Easy to adjust, always aligned |
| Section header      | Merged via grid            | Consistent with layout         |
| Table headers       | Merged via bands           | No more header squishing       |
| Data rows           | Grid-driven placement      | Easy to add/change columns     |
| Visual consistency  | All backgrounds/borders    | Professional, robust look      |

**Ready to proceed? If yes, I’ll start with the table container and header refactor, then move to headers and data rows.  
Let me know if you want to tweak the plan or have any special requirements for the table!**
