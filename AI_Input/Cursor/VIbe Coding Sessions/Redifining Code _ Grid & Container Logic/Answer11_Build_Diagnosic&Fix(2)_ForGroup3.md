Thank you for the detailed logs and description. Here’s what’s happening and how to fix it:

---

## **Diagnosis**

### 1. **Error:**
```
You must select all cells in a merged range to merge or unmerge them.
```
- This error means you are trying to call `.unmerge()` or `.merge()` on a range that **overlaps** with an existing merged range, but does not cover the entire merged area.
- In Google Sheets, you can only merge/unmerge if your range exactly matches the already-merged area.

### 2. **Why is this happening now?**
- The new container system merges the entire KPI tile area (3 rows × 2 columns for each tile).
- The `formatKpiValueWithChange` function then tries to merge/unmerge a **subrange** (the change indicator row, 1 row × 2 columns) inside that already-merged container.
- This is not allowed: you cannot merge/unmerge a subrange of an already-merged range.

---

## **How to Fix**

### **Solution:**
- **Do not merge the entire container for the KPI tile.**
  - Only merge the specific rows/cells needed for title, value, and change indicator, as before.
- The container should only set background and border, not merge the whole area.
- All merging should be handled by the content functions (`formatKpiTitle`, `formatKpiValueWithChange`, etc.).

---

## **Action Plan**

1. **Update `createContainer` in `DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js`:**
   - Remove the `.merge()` call on the whole container range for KPI tiles (and any section where you want to merge subranges).
   - Only set background and border for the container area.

2. **Leave merging to the content functions** (as is already done for title, value, and change indicator).

---

## **Next Step**

I will update `createContainer` so it does **not** merge the entire range, only sets background and border. This will resolve the merge conflict and allow the KPI tile content to merge/unmerge subranges as needed.


**The merge conflict is now fixed!**

---

### **What was changed:**
- The `createContainer` function **no longer merges the entire container range**.
- It only sets background and border for the container area.
- All merging for titles, values, and change indicators is left to the content functions (as before).

---

### **What to do next:**
1. **Re-run `testKPITilesWithContainers`** and/or refresh your dashboard.
2. The KPI tiles should now render correctly, with no merge/unmerge errors.
3. The change indicator row should merge/unmerge as needed, and the dashboard should update as expected.

---

**Let me know if this resolves the issue and if the KPI tiles look correct!  
Ready to move to Group 4 (Table refactor) when you are.**
