**Your requested visual improvements are now implemented:**

---

### **What was changed:**
- **KPI tile containers now have:**
  - **Background color:** White (`DASHBOARD_COLORS.tileBackground`), so they stand out against the dashboard background.
  - **Border color:** Medium-light grey (`DASHBOARD_COLORS.tileBorder`), not black, for a subtle but clear separation.

---

### **What to do next:**
- Run `testKPITilesWithContainers` or refresh your dashboard.
- The KPI tiles should now have a white background and a light grey border, providing the visual contrast you described (see your reference screenshot).

---

**Let me know if the visual result matches your expectations, or if you want to tweak the colors or border further!  
Ready to move to Group 4 (Table refactor) when you are.**
