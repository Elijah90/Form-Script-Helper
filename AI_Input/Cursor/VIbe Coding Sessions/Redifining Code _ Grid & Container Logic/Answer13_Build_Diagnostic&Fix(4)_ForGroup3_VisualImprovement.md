The border color for KPI tile containers is now set to **#dddddd** (the value of `DASHBOARD_COLORS.tileBorder`), ensuring a consistent light grey border instead of black.

### **What to do next:**
- Run `testKPITilesWithContainers` or refresh your dashboard.
- The KPI tile borders should now appear in the correct light grey color (`#dddddd`), matching your design requirements.

Let me know if the border color is now correct, or if you want to adjust anything else!
