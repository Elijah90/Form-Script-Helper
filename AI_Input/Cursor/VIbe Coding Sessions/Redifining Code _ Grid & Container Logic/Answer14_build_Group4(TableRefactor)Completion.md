**Your table header and data row logic is now refactored to use the new grid/band system, with full support for spacers and wide header merges as described in the Claude responses!**

---

### **What was changed:**
- **Headers now merge across bands and spacers** for better text display and alignment:
  - "Sales Rep": A–C (band1 + spacer1)
  - "Performance Metrics": D–F (band2 + spacer2)
  - "Milestone Progress": G–I (band3 + spacer3)
  - "Rewards & Negatives": J–L (band4)
- **Data rows** now match this structure, with each section spanning the same columns as its header.
- **All formatting and merging** is now grid-driven, making it easy to adjust for future needs.

---

### **How to test:**
- Refresh your dashboard or run the table test function.
- You should see:
  - Table headers that are wide, readable, and perfectly aligned with the KPI tiles above.
  - Data rows that match the header structure, with clear visual separation and correct merges.
  - Spacers are included in merges where appropriate, so headers and data are never cramped.

**Let me know if the table now matches your expectations, or if you want to tweak the band/spacer structure further!  
If all looks good, you’re ready to enjoy a robust, extensible dashboard layout!**
