Your table header and data row logic now matches the mockup and Claude's detailed band-based structure:

---

### **What was changed:**
- **Two-row header:**  
  - **Row 1:** Four wide merged headers (Rep Name, Performance Metrics, Milestone Progress, Rewards & Negatives).
  - **Row 2:** Subheaders for each data column (Rep Name, Responses, Rating, 5★ Today, 5★ Total, Milestone Progress, Reward Due, Negatives).
- **Data rows:**  
  - Each data row now matches the subheader columns, not just the four main bands.
  - Milestone Progress and Rewards & Negatives use merged cells for multi-column fields, matching the subheader structure.

---

### **How to test:**
- Refresh your dashboard.
- You should now see:
  - A two-row header with all the subheaders visible (not just four).
  - Data rows that align perfectly with the subheaders and merged cells where appropriate.

**Let me know if this matches the mockup and your expectations!  
If you want to further tweak the column merges or add more subheaders, just say so!**
