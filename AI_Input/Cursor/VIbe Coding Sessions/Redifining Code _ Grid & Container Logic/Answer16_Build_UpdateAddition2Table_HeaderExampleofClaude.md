The grid system has now been **expanded** so each band includes more columns, allowing for more granular header merges and more subheadersâ€”just as in the mockup and Claude's advanced table layout.

---

### **What to do next:**
- The table header and data row logic should now be updated to use these wider bands and spacers for merging and subheader placement.
- This will allow you to create a multi-row header with more than 4 subheaders, and to merge across bands and spacers as needed for both main and subheaders.

**Next step:**  
I will update the table header and data row logic to use the new, wider bands and spacers, and implement the two-row header structure from Claude's markdown (with all subheaders visible and aligned).

Ready to proceed?
