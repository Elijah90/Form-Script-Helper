**Column width enforcement is now implemented!**

---

### **What was changed:**
- Added `enforceDashboardColumnWidths(sheet)` in your layout utils:
  - Explicitly sets the width of every column in every band and spacer, every time you render KPI tiles or tables.
- This function is now called at the start of both `createKPITiles` and `createEmptyKPITiles`.
- This guarantees that **no matter how many columns you add to bands or spacers**, the Google Sheet will always use the correct widths from your grid config.

---

### **What to do next:**
- Refresh your dashboard or run the KPI test.
- The KPI tiles and spacers should now always respect their max width and spacing, even after grid changes or manual column resizing.

**Let me know if this resolves the width/blocking issue for the KPI tiles and spacers!  
If you want the same enforcement for the table, let me know and Iâ€™ll add it there too.**
