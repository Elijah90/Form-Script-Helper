Here’s the root cause and the fix for your KPI tile width/blocking issue:

---

## **Diagnosis**

- Your new grid system now defines each band (for KPI tiles) as **4 columns wide** (e.g., band1: columns 1,2,3,4).
- However, in `createSimpleKPITile`, you are only using the **first column of each band** (`container.columns[0]`) as the starting point for the tile, and the content/merges (e.g., for title, value, change) are only spanning 2 columns.
- This means the tile is not using the full width of its band, and the rest of the columns in the band are left unused, causing the tile to appear too narrow and not block out the full band width.

---

## **How to Fix**

- **Update `createSimpleKPITile` to use the full width of the band for each tile.**
  - When creating the container, use all columns in the band for merges and content placement.
  - For example, merge all 4 columns for the title, and use the full width for value and change indicator as well.
- This will ensure the tile always fills its band, and the width/blocking is respected.

---

## **Next Step**

I will update `createSimpleKPITile` so that:
- The container and all merges for title, value, and change indicator use the full width of the band (all 4 columns).
- This will guarantee the tile always blocks out its full band, regardless of how many columns are in the band.

Let’s make this change!


Your KPI tiles will now always use the **full width of their band**—all merges for title, value, and change indicator span all columns in the band, matching the grid config and ensuring proper blocking and alignment.

---

### **What was changed:**
- In `createSimpleKPITile`, all merges (title, value, change indicator) now use the full width of the band (e.g., all 4 columns).
- The tile will always block out its entire band, regardless of how many columns are in the band.
- This guarantees the KPI tiles will never be too narrow or misaligned, even as the grid changes.

---

### **What to do next:**
- Refresh your dashboard or run the KPI test.
- The KPI tiles should now display at the correct width, perfectly aligned with the grid and spacers.
