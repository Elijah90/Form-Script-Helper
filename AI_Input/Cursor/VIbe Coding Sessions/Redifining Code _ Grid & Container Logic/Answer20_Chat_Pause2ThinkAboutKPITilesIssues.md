Absolutely! Here’s what you want to see, based on your requirements and the image:

## **What You Want to See (KPI Tiles Visual Spec)**

1. **Each KPI tile:**
   - Is visually separated and has a white background with a light grey border.
   - Has a **max width** (e.g., 300px) and does not overflow or get too wide, regardless of how many Google Sheet columns are in the band.
   - Is split into **two visual columns**:
     - **First visual column:** Contains the main value (large, bold number).
     - **Second visual column:** Contains the subtitle (e.g., “(out of 5.0)” or “50% of total”), right-aligned or left-aligned as per design.
   - The **widths of the first and second visual columns are consistent across all tiles** (e.g., 38% and 62% of the tile width).
   - The **change indicator** (“▲ 0.4 vs. yesterday”) is on a single line, merged across the whole tile width, and colored appropriately (green/red).
   - For **% Negative Cases**, the “Action needed: X cases” message is a **cell note** (not visible in the cell, only on hover), and not shown as red text in the cell.

2. **No tile should have its value or subtitle squished or stretched.**
3. **All tiles should be visually aligned and have the same height and width.**
4. **Spacers between tiles should have a fixed width and not be merged with the tiles.**

---

## **Diagnosis of the Current Issue (from your image):**

- The **% Negative Cases** tile is showing “Action needed: 13 cases” as visible red text, not as a cell note.
- The **visual columns** are not consistent: the main value and subtitle are not always in the same place or width across tiles.
- The **max width** of the tile is not being respected; some tiles are wider or narrower than others.
- The **change indicator** and subtitle are sometimes on separate lines or not merged as intended.

## **How I Will Fix It:**

1. **Implement a true visual column system:**
   - Calculate the number of Google Sheet columns to merge for each visual column based on their pixel widths (using the band’s column widths).
   - Always merge the correct number of columns for the value and subtitle, so their widths are consistent across all tiles.

2. **Enforce max width for each tile:**
   - If the band is wider than the max width, only use as many columns as needed to reach the max width for the tile.
   - If the band is narrower, use all columns but keep the visual column proportions.

3. **Change indicator and subtitle:**
   - The change indicator row is always a single merged cell across the whole tile width.
   - For **% Negative Cases**, the “Action needed” message is set as a cell note, not as visible text.

4. **Spacers:**
   - Spacers are never merged with tiles and always have a fixed width.

**Next, I will update the code to implement these corrections.**  
Let me know if you want to tweak any of the above visual requirements before I proceed!
