**Your KPI tiles will now:**
- Always have the main value and subtitle in consistent, proportional "visual columns" (38%/62% of the tile width, as close as possible).
- Subtitle is always left-aligned in the second visual column.
- The change indicator is a single merged cell across the tile width, and for "% Negative Cases" the subtitle is a cell note only.
- All tiles will have the same max width and visual structure, regardless of the number of Google Sheet columns in the band.

---

### **What to do next:**
- Refresh your dashboard or run the KPI test.
- You should see all tiles with consistent value/subtitle placement and width, and the "Action needed" message only as a cell note.

**Let me know if this finally matches your visual requirements!  
If you want to further tweak the proportions or max width, just say so!**
