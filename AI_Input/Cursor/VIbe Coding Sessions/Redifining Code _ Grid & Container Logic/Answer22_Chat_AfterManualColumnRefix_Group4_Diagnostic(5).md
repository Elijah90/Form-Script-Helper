Thank you for the detailed screenshots and feedback! Here’s a summary of what you want, based on your final “desired” screenshot and your comments:

## **What You Want to See (Final Desired KPI Tile Layout)**

1. **Each KPI tile:**
   - Has a fixed max width (e.g., 300px) and is visually separated from other tiles by a consistent spacer.
   - Is split into **two visual columns**:
     - **First visual column:** Contains the main value, and is the same width for every tile.
     - **Second visual column:** Contains the subtitle, and is the same width for every tile.
   - The **widths of the first and second visual columns are exactly the same for all tiles** (not just proportional, but pixel-perfect across all tiles).
   - The **change indicator** is a single merged cell across the whole tile width, with the correct color and only the “Action needed” message as a cell note (not visible text).
   - **No tile or visual column is squished or stretched**; all are visually identical in width and alignment.
   - **Spacers** between tiles are always the same width and not merged with the tiles.

2. **If you select the first visual column of each tile, they are all the same width.**
3. **If you select the second visual column of each tile, they are all the same width.**
4. **If you select a spacer, all spacers are the same width.**
5. **No matter how many Google Sheet columns are in a band, the visual columns are always the same width for every tile.**

## **Diagnosis of Current Issue**

- The current code tries to approximate the visual columns by merging a variable number of Google Sheet columns, but this can result in slightly different widths for each tile’s visual columns, depending on the band’s column widths.
- Manual adjustment (as in your screenshots) achieves perfect alignment by making sure the merged columns for each visual column are always the same columns across all tiles.
- The spacers may also be inconsistent if their widths are not enforced.

## **How to Fix**

**The only way to guarantee pixel-perfect, identical visual columns for all tiles is:**
- **Use the exact same Google Sheet columns for the first and second visual columns in every tile.**
- For example:
  - Columns A, B = first visual column for all tiles
  - Columns C, D = second visual column for all tiles
  - Column E = spacer
  - Columns F, G = first visual column for tile 2, etc.
- This means the grid must be designed so that each tile’s first and second visual columns always use the same columns, and the spacers are always the same column.

---

## **Implementation Plan**

1. **Redefine the grid so that each tile always uses the same set of columns for its first and second visual columns.**
   - E.g., for 4 tiles:
     - Tile 1: A, B (first), C, D (second), E (spacer)
     - Tile 2: F, G (first), H, I (second), J (spacer)
     - Tile 3: K, L (first), M, N (second), O (spacer)
     - Tile 4: P, Q (first), R, S (second)
   - All “first” columns have the same width, all “second” columns have the same width, all spacers have the same width.

2. **Update the code so that:**
   - The first visual column is always a merge of the same two columns (e.g., A+B, F+G, etc.).
   - The second visual column is always a merge of the same two columns (e.g., C+D, H+I, etc.).
   - The title and change indicator are merged across all four columns of the tile.
   - The subtitle is always in the second visual column, left-aligned.
   - The change indicator is a single merged cell, and the “Action needed” message is a cell note only.

3. **Enforce the column widths for all first, second, and spacer columns.**

**Would you like me to proceed with this exact grid and code update?**  
If yes, I’ll update the grid and the tile rendering logic to match your final screenshot exactly.  
Let me know if you want to tweak the number of columns per visual column or the widths before I proceed!
