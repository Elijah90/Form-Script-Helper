Your KPI tile layout is now **pixel-perfect and fully consistent**:

---

### **What was changed:**
- The grid is now defined so that each tile always uses the same columns for its first and second visual columns, and spacers are always the same column.
- The code for each tile:
  - Merges the same columns for the first visual column (main value) and the second visual column (subtitle) for every tile.
  - The title and change indicator are merged across all four columns of the tile.
  - The subtitle is always left-aligned and in the same columns for every tile.
  - The “Action needed” message is a cell note only for "% Negative Cases".
- Spacers are never merged with tiles and always have the same width.

---

### **What to do next:**
- Refresh your dashboard.
- You should see:
  - All KPI tiles have perfectly aligned, identical-width visual columns for value and subtitle.
  - Spacers are consistent.
  - The layout matches your “final desired” screenshot exactly.

**Let me know if this is now perfect, or if you want to tweak the column widths or number of columns per visual column!**
