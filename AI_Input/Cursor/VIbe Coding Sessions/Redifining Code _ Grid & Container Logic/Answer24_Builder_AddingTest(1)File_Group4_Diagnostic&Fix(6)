Here’s a thorough diagnosis and a plan to resolve the issues:

---

## **Diagnosis**

### 1. **Only the First Tile Appears**
- In your new grid, each tile’s first column is now: 1 (A), 6 (F), 11 (K), 16 (P).
- In `createKPITiles`, the `kpiTiles` array is still using columns 1, 4, 7, 10 for the four tiles.
- As a result, only the first tile (column 1) matches the new grid, so only it appears; the others are skipped by the new band-mapping logic.

### 2. **Tile Widths Not Respected**
- The legacy `setDashboardColumnWidths` and possibly other width-setting code is still being called, which sets columns A–K to old widths, conflicting with the new grid.
- The new grid’s `enforceDashboardColumnWidths` is called, but the legacy function may override or conflict with it.

### 3. **Column Mapping**
- The new grid expects each tile to use a specific set of columns for its first and second visual columns, but the `kpiTiles` config and tile creation logic are not updated to match.

## **What Needs to Change**

1. **Update the `kpiTiles` array in `createKPITiles`** to use the correct starting columns for each tile:
   - Tile 1: column 1 (A)
   - Tile 2: column 6 (F)
   - Tile 3: column 11 (K)
   - Tile 4: column 16 (P)

2. **Remove or comment out all calls to `setDashboardColumnWidths`** and any other legacy width-setting functions in the KPI and table creation code. Only use `enforceDashboardColumnWidths`.

3. **Ensure all tile creation and merging logic uses the new grid’s columns.**

---

## **Next Steps**

I will:
- Update the `kpiTiles` array in `createKPITiles` to use the correct columns.
- Remove all calls to `setDashboardColumnWidths` in the KPI and table creation code.
- Double-check that only the new grid and enforcement logic is used.

**This will ensure all four tiles appear, and the container/tile widths are respected and consistent.**
