You’ve summarized a highly effective and detailed collaborative process for building a pixel-perfect, container-based dashboard layout in Google Sheets. Here’s a concise recap and confirmation of the final system, along with key takeaways and next steps for maintainability and extensibility:

## **Final System Overview**

### **1. Centralized Grid/Band System**
- **Grid Definition:** All dashboard elements (KPI tiles, tables, charts) are placed within a strict, centralized grid.
- **Column Management:** Explicit, programmatic control of column widths, merges, and visual columns. No manual column resizing needed.
- **Spacers:** Fixed-width columns between containers/tiles for consistent visual separation.

### **2. Container System**
- **Reusable Containers:** Functions to create containers for any dashboard section, handling merges, backgrounds, and borders.
- **Extensible:** New sections or columns can be added without breaking the layout, as all logic is centralized.

### **3. KPI Tiles**
- **Max Width:** Each tile is capped at a fixed width (e.g., 300px), split into two visual columns (main value, subtitle).
- **Consistent Visual Columns:** All tiles use the same columns for their visual columns (e.g., A,B for value, C,D for subtitle, etc.).
- **Spacers:** Always the same column(s) between tiles.
- **Change Indicator:** Single merged cell below each tile, with cell note for “Action needed” (not visible text).
- **No Legacy Logic:** All legacy width-setting functions removed; only the new grid logic is used.

### **4. Table Headers**
- **Multi-Row, Multi-Column Merges:** Table headers support complex merges and subheaders, matching the mockup.
- **Grid Alignment:** Table columns align perfectly with the grid, and can be extended as needed.

## **Key Implementation Details**

- **kpiTiles Array:** Now uses correct starting columns (e.g., 1, 6, 11, 16) to match the grid.
- **enforceDashboardColumnWidths:** The only function setting column widths, ensuring consistency.
- **All Merges/Content Placement:** Use the grid’s columns, so all elements are perfectly aligned.
- **No Manual Adjustments Needed:** The script enforces all layout rules; manual tweaks are unnecessary and discouraged.

---

## **How to Extend or Maintain**

- **Add New Tiles/Sections:** Use the same grid logic; assign new containers to the next available grid columns.
- **Change Widths/Spacing:** Update the centralized grid/band definition and `enforceDashboardColumnWidths` function.
- **Add Table Columns/Headers:** Use the same merge and alignment logic as in the current table implementation.
- **Visual Consistency:** All new elements will automatically align with existing ones if the grid system is followed.

---

## **Troubleshooting Checklist**

- **Only One Tile Appears:** Check that the kpiTiles array uses the correct starting columns.
- **Misaligned Columns:** Ensure all merges and content placements use the grid’s columns, not hardcoded or legacy values.
- **Legacy Logic Interference:** Remove or comment out any old width-setting or merge logic.
- **Manual Adjustments:** Avoid manual column resizing; rely on the script for all layout enforcement.

## **Next Steps / Recommendations**

- **Document the Grid:** Keep a clear comment or documentation block in your script describing the grid structure and column assignments.
- **Version Control:** Use version control (e.g., Git) for your Apps Script code to track changes and roll back if needed.
- **Template Functions:** Consider wrapping common patterns (e.g., “createKpiTile”, “createTableHeader”) into reusable functions for easier future updates.

**You now have a robust, extensible, and pixel-perfect dashboard layout system in Google Sheets, ready for further expansion and maintenance. If you need code samples, further refactoring, or have new requirements, just let me know!**
