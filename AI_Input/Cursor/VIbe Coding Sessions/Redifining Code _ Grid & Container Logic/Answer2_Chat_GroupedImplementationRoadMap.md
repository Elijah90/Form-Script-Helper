Great approach! Grouping the changes into logical, testable phases will make the transition smooth and let you verify each part before moving on. Hereâ€™s a **grouped implementation roadmap** with clear checkpoints for testing after each group.

# ðŸŸ¢ **Grouped Implementation Roadmap**

## **Group 1: Centralized Grid/Band System**

**Goal:**  
Establish a single source of truth for all column positions, widths, and bands.

**Tasks:**
- Create a `DashboardGrid` config object (e.g., in `LayoutUtils` or a new module).
- Write a function to set all column widths and return a mapping of band names to column indices.
- (Optional) Add a helper to visualize the grid (e.g., color each band differently for debugging).

**Test:**  
- Run a script that sets up the grid and visually confirms that columns and bands are correct (widths, spacers, etc.).
- No dashboard content yetâ€”just the grid.

---

## **Group 2: Container System for Section Placement**

**Goal:**  
Enable easy placement and formatting of dashboard sections (KPI tiles, tables, etc.) using containers.

**Tasks:**
- Implement a `createContainer` function that:
  - Accepts band(s), start row, and number of rows.
  - Handles merging, background, and border formatting.
  - Returns the range for content rendering.
- Document how to use the container system for new sections.

**Test:**  
- Use the container system to create empty containers for KPI tiles and the table.
- Visually confirm that containers are placed and merged correctly, with backgrounds and borders.

---

## **Group 3: Refactor KPI Tiles to Use Grid & Containers**

**Goal:**  
Render KPI tiles using the new grid and container system.

**Tasks:**
- Refactor KPI tile creation to use the container system for placement and merging.
- Render content (title, value, change indicator) inside the container, using the grid for column indices.
- Ensure all merges, backgrounds, and alignments are correct.

**Test:**  
- Run the dashboard and confirm that KPI tiles appear as expected, perfectly aligned to the grid.
- Check that adding/removing a tile or changing its width is easy and does not break layout.

---

## **Group 4: Refactor Table to Use Grid & Containers**

**Goal:**  
Render the Representative Performance table using the new system.

**Tasks:**
- Refactor the table module to use the container system for the table area.
- Create headers and data rows using the band definitions for merges and alignment.
- Ensure headers are merged appropriately for long text and that data rows align.

**Test:**  
- Run the dashboard and confirm that the table aligns with KPI tiles, headers are merged and readable, and data rows are correct.
- Check that adding/removing columns or changing header text does not break alignment.

---

## **Group 5: Extensibility & New Section Demo**

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate how to add a new dashboard section (e.g., a chart or new KPI band) using the system.

**Tasks:**
- Add a new band to the grid config and update column widths.
- Create a new container for a new section (e.g., a chart spanning Bands 1â€“2).
- Ensure all merges and formatting are handled by the container system.

**Test:**  
- Add a new section and confirm it appears correctly, with no impact on existing layout.
- Document the process for future additions.

# **Summary Table**

| Group | Focus                        | Test/Checkpoint                        |
|-------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1     | Centralized grid/band system | Visual grid setup, column widths/bands |
| 2     | Container system             | Empty containers, correct placement    |
| 3     | KPI tiles refactor           | KPI tiles align, easy to adjust        |
| 4     | Table refactor               | Table aligns, headers/data correct     |
| 5     | Extensibility demo           | Add new section, no layout breakage    |

**Let me know if you want to adjust the grouping or if youâ€™re ready to start with Group 1!**  
Once you approve, Iâ€™ll provide the detailed plan and code outline for the first group.
