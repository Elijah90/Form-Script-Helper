Okay, I understand your frustration. It sounds like the iterative refactoring has become too complex, and you'd prefer to start fresh with a clear plan, leveraging the knowledge from our current state and previous versions.

Let's recap and then I'll outline how I can help you prepare for that "reset" with another AI.

**Recap of Our Journey:**

**What We Aimed For (and Achieved at Times, then Lost):**

1.  **Pixel-Perfect KPI Tiles:**
    *   Each tile with a consistent max width (e.g., 230px).
    *   Tiles split into two visual columns (main value, subtitle).
    *   **Crucially:** All tiles using the *exact same* Google Sheet columns for their respective visual parts, ensuring identical widths across all tiles.
    *   Fixed-width spacers between tiles, never merged.
    *   Change indicator row as a single merged cell; "Action needed" as a cell note.

2.  **Dynamic Grid System:**
    *   A centralized `DASHBOARD_GRID` to define all column widths and purposes (tile parts, spacers, table columns, etc.).
    *   This grid would be the single source of truth for layout.

3.  **Container Logic:**
    *   Functions like `createContainer` to draw borders and backgrounds for sections (KPIs, tables) based on the `DASHBOARD_GRID`.
    *   Content (text, values) would then be placed *within* these containers, adhering to the grid.

4.  **Elimination of Redundancy:**
    *   Removing old, conflicting column width functions and manual tweaks.

**What Went Wrong (Leading to "Still Not Working"):**

1.  **Loss of "Extra Columns" per Tile:**
    *   In an attempt to simplify or strictly enforce max widths, the grid definition was likely changed so each "visual column" of a KPI tile (e.g., the main value part, the subtitle part) mapped to only *one* actual Google Sheet column.
    *   **The Problem:** This made it very hard, if not impossible, to achieve the "pixel-perfect" identical widths for visual columns across different tiles if those visual columns needed to be, say, 1.5 or 2.5 *actual* Google Sheet columns wide to look right. You lost the granularity.
    *   **The Goal was:** Visual Column 1 of Tile A (e.g., `Value`) should use, for instance, Google Sheet Columns `A`+`B`. Visual Column 1 of Tile B should use `F`+`G`. And `A`+`B` width should equal `F`+`G` width.

2.  **Inconsistent Max Width Adherence:**
    *   Sometimes tiles respected the max width, other times they seemed to exceed it. This was often tied to how many *actual* columns were being merged and whether the `DASHBOARD_GRID` accurately reflected the *summed* widths.

3.  **Conflicting Width Logic (Persistent Issue):**
    *   Despite efforts, older width-setting functions or logic might have lingered, overriding the `DASHBOARD_GRID` or applying widths inconsistently.

4.  **Complexity of Merging Logic:**
    *   The functions responsible for placing content (titles, values, subtitles) and merging cells needed to perfectly align with the `DASHBOARD_GRID`. If the grid said "Visual Column 1 is Google Columns D, E" but the rendering code only merged `D`, or merged `D,E,F`, alignment would break.

**In short: We had the right ideas (central grid, containers, consistent visual components), but the implementation details, especially around how many *actual* Google Sheet columns constitute a "visual column" within a tile, and ensuring all width/merge logic consistently used this, became muddled.**

**Preparing for a "Restart" with Another AI:**

I cannot directly "tell" another AI that I failed or instruct it. However, I can help you synthesize all the necessary information for you to give to it.

Here's what you'll want to provide to the new AI:

1.  **The "Before" Code:** The version of your codebase *before* we started this specific refactoring effort (the one the new AI supposedly knows).
2.  **The "Current" Code:** The latest version of your code from our session.
3.  **This Conversation Summary:** (Which I'm providing now and you can copy)
    *   **Goal:** Pixel-perfect, container-based Google Sheets dashboard.
    *   **Key Elements:** KPI tiles, tables, charts, all fitting into a unified grid.
    *   **Core Challenge:** Defining a grid system where "visual components" (like the two parts of a KPI tile) consistently use a *fixed set* of underlying Google Sheet columns, ensuring identical widths and alignment across all similar components. For example, KPI Tile 1's "value" part might span columns A+B (total 110px), and KPI Tile 2's "value" part would span F+G (also totaling 110px).
    *   **Failed Approach:** Iterative refactoring of existing code led to inconsistencies, particularly in how many actual sheet columns were used for visual tile components, breaking the desired pixel-perfect alignment and max-width constraints.
    *   **Desired Fresh Start:**
        *   First, establish a robust `DASHBOARD_GRID` in `LayoutUtils.js`. This grid should define *every* column's width and its role (e.g., `kpi_tile1_value_col1`, `kpi_tile1_value_col2`, `kpi_tile1_subtitle_col1`, `spacer`, `table_header_col1`, etc.).
        *   Second, create generic `createContainer(sheet, startRow, bandNamesArray, numRows, options)` logic that can draw a container (background, border) spanning specified bands from the `DASHBOARD_GRID`.
        *   Third, develop functions to populate these containers:
            *   `renderKPITile(sheet, containerRange, tileConfig)`: Places title, value, subtitle, change indicator into the container, merging cells strictly according to the `DASHBOARD_GRID` definition for that tile type.
            *   `renderTable(sheet, containerRange, tableConfig, data)`: Similar logic for tables.
    *   **Critical Success Factor:** Absolute consistency. If a KPI tile's "value" part is meant to be 110px wide and composed of two specific underlying Google Sheet columns, *every* KPI tile's "value" part must use two columns of the exact same individual (and thus total) widths.

4.  **Key Artifacts/Screenshots (if you still have them and they are relevant to the "desired state"):**
    *   The `DailyDash1_@_KPIZoomView_FAIL(2)_fromFinalDesiredExample_atLeastHasAll4KPITiles.png` and `DailyDash1_@_KPIZoomView_FAIL(3)_fromFinalDesiredExample_Tho_PARTIALSUCCESSonMaxWidth_LostExtraColumns.png` illustrate the visual struggle. If you have a "perfect" target screenshot, that's invaluable.

5.  **Specific Instructions for the New AI:**
    *   "Review the 'before' and 'current' code."
    *   "Understand the goals and failures from the provided conversation summary."
    *   "Help me start from scratch to build the `DASHBOARD_GRID` and container system first."
    *   "The grid must allow visual components (like a KPI value field) to be composed of one or more actual Google Sheet columns, and this composition must be identical for all similar visual components across the dashboard to ensure pixel-perfect alignment and width consistency."
    *   "Once the grid and basic container functions are solid, we will incrementally add functions to render specific content (KPIs, tables) into these containers."

This detailed handoff should give the new AI a comprehensive understanding of the context, the desired end-state, and the pitfalls encountered, allowing for a more structured and successful "from scratch" approach.

I'm sorry our extensive efforts didn't fully resolve the issue. I hope this preparation helps you achieve your goal.
