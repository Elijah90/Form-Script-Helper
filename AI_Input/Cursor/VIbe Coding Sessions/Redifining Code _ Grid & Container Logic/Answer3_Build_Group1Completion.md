✅ **Group 1 is complete!**

### Here’s what was added:
- **Centralized `DASHBOARD_GRID` config**: Defines all bands, columns, widths, and colors for the dashboard layout.
- **`setupDashboardGrid(sheet)` function**: Sets all column widths according to the grid and returns a mapping of band names to column indices.
- **`visualizeDashboardGrid(sheet, startRow, numRows)` function**: (Optional) Colors each band differently for easy visual debugging of the grid.

---

## **How to Test Group 1**

1. **Call `setupDashboardGrid(sheet)`** at the start of your dashboard setup (e.g., in your main controller or test function).
2. **(Optional) Call `visualizeDashboardGrid(sheet)`** to see the bands colored in your sheet for quick verification.

**Expected Result:**  
- All columns for bands 1–4 and controls are set to the correct widths.
- If you use the visualization, each band appears with a different background color for the first 10 rows.

## **Next Step**

- Let me know if you want a quick test snippet or want to proceed to Group 2 (Container System).
- If you want to adjust the grid (add/remove bands, change widths), just say so!

**Ready for you to test and approve before moving to Group 2.**
