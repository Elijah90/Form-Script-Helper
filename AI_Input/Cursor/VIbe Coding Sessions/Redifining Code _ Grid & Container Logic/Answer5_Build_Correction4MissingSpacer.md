The grid config and visualization have now been updated to **explicitly include the spacer columns as their own bands**. This means:

- Each KPI tile band (band1, band2, band3, band4) is now separated by a dedicated spacer band (spacer1, spacer2, spacer3).
- The spacers have their own color in the visualization, so you’ll see clear separation between tiles.
- The grid structure is now more accurate and easier to extend or adjust in the future.

## **How to Test**

- Run your `testVisualizeGrid` function again.
- You should now see alternating colored bands and spacers, matching the intended layout (e.g., blue for spacers, other colors for tiles).

**This is the right time to include spacers, and you do not need to worry about them in later groups—they are now part of the grid system!**

Let me know if the visualization now matches your expectations, or if you want to tweak the band/spacer widths or colors further.  
Ready to move to Group 2 when you are!
