✅ **Group 2 (Container System) is now implemented!**

### **What’s new:**
- **`createContainer` function:**  
  - Lets you define a dashboard section by specifying which bands (and/or spacers) and how many rows it should span.
  - Handles merging, background, border, and optional title.
  - Returns info about the container’s range and columns for use by content functions.

- **`testContainerSystem` function:**  
  - Demonstrates creating:
    - A KPI tile container (band1)
    - A table container spanning band2, spacer2, band3
    - A full-width container (all bands and spacers)
  - Clears a test area and sets up the grid for easy visual debugging.

---

## **How to Test**

1. **Run `testContainerSystem`** from the Apps Script editor.
2. **Check your sheet**: You should see three labeled, bordered, and colored containers in rows 12–22, perfectly aligned to the grid and spacers.

---

## **Next Steps**

- Let me know if you want to tweak the container logic or test with different bands/rows.
- When you’re happy, we’ll move to **Group 3: Refactor KPI Tiles to Use Grid & Containers**.

**Ready for your feedback or to proceed!**
