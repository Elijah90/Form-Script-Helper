Your observations are **completely expected** and show that the new container system is working as intended for testing!

---

## **What’s Happening?**

- **First Screenshot:**  
  This is the result of running `testContainerSystem`.  
  - It **clears a test area** (rows 12–23) and draws three sample containers (KPI tile, table section, full-width section) with test backgrounds and titles.
  - This is just a **visual test** to show that the new container logic works and aligns perfectly with your grid/bands.

- **Second Screenshot:**  
  This is your **real dashboard** after you clear and refresh.  
  - It shows the actual KPI tiles and the Representative Performance table, with the current issues in table headers and data display (which we’ll address in the next groups).

---

## **Should You Be Concerned?**

**No!**  
- The test function (`testContainerSystem`) is **just for development/debugging**. It does not affect your real dashboard logic or data.
- When you clear and refresh, your dashboard returns to its normal state, as expected.

---

## **What’s Next?**

- Now that the grid and container system are working, we’ll move on to **Group 3: Refactor KPI Tiles to Use Grid & Containers**.
- This will start making your real dashboard sections (KPI tiles, then tables) use the new, robust layout logic—eliminating the need for manual fixes and aligning everything perfectly.

---

**Summary:**  
- The test containers are for visual confirmation only.
- Your real dashboard is unaffected and will use the new system as we refactor each section.
- You’re right on track!

**Ready to proceed to Group 3 (KPI Tiles refactor), or do you want to test/tweak anything else with containers first?**
