**Group 3 (KPI Tiles Refactor) is complete!**

### What was changed:
- **KPI tiles now use the new container system:**  
  - Each tile is created with `createContainer`, which handles merging, background, and border.
  - All content (title, value, change indicator) is placed using the container’s columns, ensuring perfect alignment with the grid.
  - No more manual range calculations or direct formatting—everything is grid-driven.

- **`createKPITiles` and `createEmptyKPITiles`** now use the new approach for all tiles.

- **A new test function `testKPITilesWithContainers`** lets you quickly see all four KPI tiles rendered using the container system for visual confirmation.

---

## **How to Test**

1. **Run `testKPITilesWithContainers`** in the Apps Script editor.
2. **Check your sheet:**  
   - The four KPI tiles should appear in the correct bands, perfectly aligned, with all formatting and merging handled by the container system.

3. **Refresh your dashboard as usual:**  
   - The real KPI tiles will now use the new robust layout logic.

## **Next Steps**

- Let me know if you want to tweak the tile appearance or test with different data.
- When you’re happy, we’ll move to **Group 4: Refactor the Table to Use Grid & Containers**.

**Ready for your feedback or to proceed!**
