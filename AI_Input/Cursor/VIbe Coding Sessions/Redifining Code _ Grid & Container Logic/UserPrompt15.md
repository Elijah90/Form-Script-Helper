this didnt work the way we expected it's still showing only 4 headers (as per 'DailyDash1_@_GridLayoutImplementationFAIL4TableRep(1).png') while in the mock up (Screenshot 20250510 at 5.17.43â€¯PM.png) you can see that there is more than 4.Try tyo solve this. It think we tought about the new logic grid and container layout but the table had develop an issue itself along the line. Please diagnose and correct the necessary based on our context and the mock up indications.
