something is being left out I dont know what but the container is not readjusted. As a matter of fact find attached the test (Test1.md ) I performed to get width. If there any other log you want. Please let me know so you can enhance the code. 
Note per the image that the issues are:
• Only First tiles appear now. 
• Even that first tiles is not respecting the container/tile width.

Check all codes module provided to you just in case there is conflict in another module
