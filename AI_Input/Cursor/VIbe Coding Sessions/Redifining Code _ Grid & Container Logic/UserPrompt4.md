okay when I refreshed by pressing the button nothing happened 
but when I ran the function 'visualizeDashboardGrid', it failed and I had  an error:
"""

Again Im a novice at this and I might know know some implied stuff like perhaps change the sheet name to test on new sheet or something like that I barely read the code myself cause I dont understand javascript. Did you mean to rebuild the dashboard so this test should be done on a new sheet? If no (even if yes too), what happened?
