it didnt work!

When It set the Dashboard dropdown to a dataset (for example 'TestData Old (May 7th)' on the first attached screenshot) where the dates are '5/6/2025' and '5/7/2025' (again today's date is '5/8/2025' or May 8th 2025) it does show again figures zero ((as main KPI figures of that current day) which is great and show the variation indicators (▲ or ▼) and their figures (as in variation from prior day to '5/7/2025'; for example you might see ▼80 as variation in Submissions today' title because no sub that day but I have 80 submission per day in that testdata)

NOW, I still have the issues I had when I set the sheet to the most recently filled testdata  ('TestData' selected on the second attached screenshot). It doesn show the variation indicators (▲ or ▼) nor any of their figures (as in variation from prior day to 5/8/2025) but at least  it shows the main figures of the tiles and since today is '5/8/2025' and the testday sheet table for today (TestData) has data for today and yesterday (80 each) it shows figures whcih mean the calculation are working (we can assume at least)

Please again review the code knowing what I need

# Dashboard Variation Indicator Issue Analysis

Based on the screenshots and your description, I understand the issue you're facing with the dashboard:

1. When using "TestData Old (May 7th)" dataset:
   - Shows zero figures for the current day (5/8/2025) correctly
   - Shows variation indicators (▲ or ▼) and their figures correctly

2. When using "TestData" dataset:
   - Shows the main figures correctly (80 submissions)
   - Does NOT show variation indicators (▲ or ▼) or their figures

The issue appears to be with how the variation indicators are calculated and displayed when using the most recent dataset that includes today's data.

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at the code in `DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js`, I can see the issue is likely in the `formatKpiValueWithChange` function. This function is responsible for displaying the variation indicators, but it might not be handling the case where the current day is the same as the latest data day.

The key part of the code that needs to be fixed is:

```javascript:
// If no change, we're done
if (change === 0) return;
```

This line is causing the variation indicators not to appear when the change value is 0, which might be happening when comparing today's data with yesterday's data in the "TestData" dataset (since both days have 80 submissions).

## Solution

We need to modify the `formatKpiValueWithChange` function in the `DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js` file to handle the case where the change is 0 but we still want to show a variation indicator. Here's how to fix it:

```javascript:/Users/jean-axelpotey/Documents/Winsurf Home Folder/Casamance Projects/Form Script + Helper/CODE/NEW/DailyDashboard_NewLogic1/DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js
/**
 * Formats a KPI value with change indicator
 * @param {Sheet} sheet - The Google Sheet
 * @param {number} row - The row for the main value
 * @param {number} column - The column for the main value
 * @param {any} value - The main KPI value
 * @param {number} change - The change value
 * @param {boolean} reverseColors - Whether to reverse the color logic
 */
function formatKpiValueWithChange(sheet, row, column, value, change, reverseColors = false) {
  // Format the main value in the first column
  sheet.getRange(row, column)
       .setValue(value)
       .setFontSize(36)
       .setFontWeight("bold")
       .setFontColor(DASHBOARD_COLORS.headerText)
       .setVerticalAlignment("middle")
       .setHorizontalAlignment("left")
       // Add number formatting to prevent percentage issues
       .setNumberFormat("@"); // Display as plain text
  
  // Always show change indicator, even if change is 0
  let changeText = "";
  let changeColor = DASHBOARD_COLORS.subText;
  
  if (change > 0) {
    changeText = "▲ " + Math.abs(change);
    changeColor = reverseColors ? DASHBOARD_COLORS.negative : DASHBOARD_COLORS.positive;
  } else if (change < 0) {
    changeText = "▼ " + Math.abs(change);
    changeColor = reverseColors ? DASHBOARD_COLORS.positive : DASHBOARD_COLORS.negative;
  } else {
    // When change is exactly 0, show a neutral indicator
    changeText = "◆ 0";
    changeColor = DASHBOARD_COLORS.neutral;
  }
  
  // Add the change indicator in the column to the right
  sheet.getRange(row, column + 1)
       .setValue(changeText)
       .setFontSize(14)
       .setFontColor(changeColor)
       .setVerticalAlignment("middle")
       .setHorizontalAlignment("left");
}
```

This modification:

1. Removes the early return when change is 0
2. Adds a new condition to handle the case where change is exactly 0
3. Uses a diamond symbol (◆) to indicate no change, with a neutral blue color
4. Always displays the change indicator, ensuring consistency across all datasets

This should fix the issue where the variation indicators don't appear when using the "TestData" dataset that has the same values for today and yesterday.

## Additional Recommendations

1. Make sure the data comparison logic in your KPI calculation functions is correctly identifying "today" and "yesterday" based on the selected dataset.

2. Consider adding debug logging to verify the actual change values being calculated for each KPI.

3. If you still encounter issues after this fix, you might need to examine how the change values are being calculated in the first place, as the problem could be upstream from the display logic.
