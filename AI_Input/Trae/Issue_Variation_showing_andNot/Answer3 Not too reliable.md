After analyzing your Google Apps Script code for the CASAMANCE Daily Dashboard, I've identified the issue with the variation indicators in your KPI tiles.

## The Problem

The dashboard is showing variation indicators (▲ or ▼) when there's no data for today, but not showing them when there is data for today and yesterday. This is happening because:

1. The dashboard is correctly calculating "today" based on the current system date
2. When your test data has dates from 5/6/2025 and earlier (first image), the dashboard shows variations because it's comparing "no data today" with "data from yesterday"
3. When your test data includes today's date (5/8/2025) and yesterday's date (5/7/2025) (third image), the dashboard is calculating variations but not displaying them correctly

## Root Cause

Looking at your `createKPITiles` function in the `DailyDash_New [KPI Titles].js` file, I found that:

1. The code correctly identifies today's and yesterday's dates
2. It properly calculates the changes between today and yesterday
3. The issue is in how the variations are displayed when using the `formatKpiValueWithChange` function

The key issue is in the `formatKpiValueWithChange` function in the `LayoutUtils.js` file:

```javascript
function formatKpiValueWithChange(sheet, row, column, value, change, reverseColors = false) {
  // Format the main value in the first column
  const valueCell = sheet.getRange(row, column)
       .setValue(value)
       .setFontSize(36)
       .setFontWeight("bold")
       .setFontColor(DASHBOARD_COLORS.headerText)
       .setVerticalAlignment("middle")
       .setHorizontalAlignment("left");
  
  // If no change, we're done
  if (change === 0) return;
  
  // Create the change indicator text
  let changeText = "";
  let changeColor = DASHBOARD_COLORS.subText;
  
  if (change > 0) {
    changeText = "▲ " + Math.abs(change);
    changeColor = reverseColors ? DASHBOARD_COLORS.negative : DASHBOARD_COLORS.positive;
  } else if (change < 0) {
    changeText = "▼ " + Math.abs(change);
    changeColor = reverseColors ? DASHBOARD_COLORS.positive : DASHBOARD_COLORS.negative;
  }
  
  // Add the change indicator directly next to the main value
  sheet.getRange(row, column + 1)
       .setValue(changeText)
       .setFontSize(14)
       .setFontColor(changeColor)
       .setVerticalAlignment("middle")
       .setHorizontalAlignment("left");
}
```

## The Solution

The issue is that when there's no data for today (first image), the dashboard is showing zeros with the variations from yesterday. But when there is data for today (third image), the dashboard is showing today's data but not properly displaying the variations.

Here's what needs to be fixed:

1. **Don't return early when change is 0**: The function is returning early when `change === 0`, but it should still clear any previous change indicators in that case.

2. **Handle the case when there's no data for today**: When there's no data for today, the dashboard should show zeros with variations, which is what you're seeing in the first image.

3. **Ensure variations are displayed even when there's data for today**: The dashboard should always show variations when comparing today with yesterday, regardless of whether there's data for today.

## Recommended Code Change

Here's how you should modify the `formatKpiValueWithChange` function in the `LayoutUtils.js` file:

```javascript:absolute/path/to/CODE/NEW/DailyDashboard_NewLogic1/DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js
function formatKpiValueWithChange(sheet, row, column, value, change, reverseColors = false) {
  // Format the main value in the first column
  const valueCell = sheet.getRange(row, column)
       .setValue(value)
       .setFontSize(36)
       .setFontWeight("bold")
       .setFontColor(DASHBOARD_COLORS.headerText)
       .setVerticalAlignment("middle")
       .setHorizontalAlignment("left");
  
  // Create the change indicator text
  let changeText = "";
  let changeColor = DASHBOARD_COLORS.subText;
  
  if (change > 0) {
    changeText = "▲ " + Math.abs(change);
    changeColor = reverseColors ? DASHBOARD_COLORS.negative : DASHBOARD_COLORS.positive;
  } else if (change < 0) {
    changeText = "▼ " + Math.abs(change);
    changeColor = reverseColors ? DASHBOARD_COLORS.positive : DASHBOARD_COLORS.negative;
  } else {
    // When change is exactly 0, clear any previous change indicator
    sheet.getRange(row, column + 1).clearContent();
    return;
  }
  
  // Add the change indicator directly next to the main value
  sheet.getRange(row, column + 1)
       .setValue(changeText)
       .setFontSize(14)
       .setFontColor(changeColor)
       .setVerticalAlignment("middle")
       .setHorizontalAlignment("left");
}
```

The key change is removing the early return when `change === 0` and instead clearing the content of the change indicator cell in that case. This ensures that:

1. When there's a non-zero change, it will display the appropriate indicator
2. When there's zero change, it will clear any previous indicator
3. The function will always handle the change indicator cell appropriately

This should fix the issue without changing how the dashboard determines "today" based on the system date, which is the behavior you want to maintain.
