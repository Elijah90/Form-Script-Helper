# Dashboard KPI Tiles Refactoring Summary

## Session 1: Analysis and Initial Refactor Plan

### User Goal Summary (Based on User's Second Prompt)

The user, after attempting to consolidate layout elements into a `LayoutUtils` module, encountered issues with KPI tile display. The goal was to review the Git commit history to find a version where KPI tiles were working correctly and to get a refactoring plan to address the current problems, referencing the identified working state.

### AI Actions & Affected Modules

1. **Git History Review:**

    * Executed `git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s" --date=short -n 20` for a general overview of recent commits.
    * Executed `git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s" --date=short --grep="SUCCESS" -i -n 5` to find successful versions, identifying commit `fe47e4f` ("Updating (4)Module to Lastest Isssues (Variation Showing depending on data date) [SUCCESS]") as potentially relevant.
    * Viewed file contents from commit `fe47e4f` (`DailyDash_New [KPI Titles].js`, `DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js`) using `git show fe47e4f:<path_to_file>`.
    * Viewed file contents from a more recent problematic commit `804afc2` ("Refactor(DailyDashboard) [FAIL]: adjust KPI tile layout and fix rich text handling") for comparison.

2. **Proposed Refactoring Plan (Based on Comparison):**

    * **`DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js`**:
        * Modify `formatKpiValueWithChange` to simplify the display of change indicators, initially removing RichText to address failures encountered in commit `804afc2`.
    * **`DailyDash_New [KPI Titles].js`**:
        * Clean up `createEmptyKPITiles` to ensure consistent row heights, spacing, and correct column placement for empty tiles.
        * Modify `createSimpleKPITile` to handle special cases for different tile types more cleanly (e.g., how subtitles or secondary info are displayed).
    * **`DailyDash_New [Module Controller].js`**:
        * Add more extensive debug logging and implement try/catch blocks around module calls for increased robustness and easier troubleshooting.

## Session 2: Implementing the 3-Row KPI Structure

### User Goal Summary (Based on User's Third Prompt)

The user provided a visual target (`DailyDash1__Moving_▼__X__DisplaysSUCCESS.png` / `Screenshot 2025-05-11 at 9.30.54 AM.png`) for a compact 3-row KPI tile structure. Specific requirements included:

* Each tile container should span 3 rows.
* Row 6 of the sheet (the 3rd row of the KPI tile) should be a single merged cell for the change indicator line.
* Variation indicators (e.g., "▲ 50") and "vs. yesterday" text to appear together in this merged 3rd row, maintaining individual color logic (dynamic for indicator, static for text).
* Secondary information like "(out of 5.0)" (for Average Rating) and "% of total" (for 5-Star Ratings) to move to the second cell of the value row (row 5 of the sheet / 2nd row of the tile).
* The "Action needed: X cases" message for the "% Negative Cases" tile to become a cell comment on its change indicator line.

### AI Actions & Affected Modules (Session 2)

#### 1. DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js Modifications

##### setKpiRowHeights Function

* Adjusted to define heights for a 3-row KPI tile structure:
  * Title row (25px)
  * Main value row (50px)
  * Change indicator row (25px)

##### formatKpiValueWithChange Function

* Modified signature to include `tileTitle` and `tileSubtitle` parameters for KPI tile-specific logic
* Value Row Logic (`startRow + 1`):
  * Main KPI value placed in first cell (`column`)
  * For "Average Rating": "(out of 5.0)" in second cell (`column + 1`)
  * For "5-Star Ratings": `tileSubtitle` (e.g., "X% of total") in second cell (`column + 1`)
* Change Indicator Row Logic (`startRow + 2`):
  * Cell at `(startRow + 2, column)` merged across 2 columns
  * Combined text (e.g., "▲ 50 vs. yesterday") using `SpreadsheetApp.newRichTextValue()` for dual coloring
  * For "% Negative Cases": `tileSubtitle` as cell note on merged cell

#### 2. DailyDash_New [KPI Titles].js Modifications

##### createSimpleKPITile Function

* Updated `formatTile` call for 3-row container: `sheet.getRange(startRow, tileConfig.column, 3, 2)`
* Implemented revamped `formatKpiValueWithChange` for value row (`startRow + 1`)
* Removed `formatKpiSubtitle` call (logic integrated into `formatKpiValueWithChange`)

##### createKPITiles Function

* Updated `clearSectionArea` for 3-row tiles
* Modified `addSectionSpacing` to `startRow + 2`
* Adjusted return value to `startRow + 3`

##### createEmptyKPITiles Function

* Aligned `clearSectionArea` and `addSectionSpacing` with 3-row structure

## Session 3: Troubleshooting and Refinement of 3-Row Structure

### User Goal Summary (Follow-up to Session 2)

The user reported an undesirable visual state ("State B" - `Screenshot 2025-05-11 at 9.22.55 AM.png`) showing unexpected 4th row content. The goal remained achieving the desired 3-row compact structure ("State C" - `Screenshot 2025-05-11 at 9.30.54 AM.png`).

### AI Actions & Affected Modules (Session 3)

#### 1. Code Review & Diagnosis

* Verified removal of `formatKpiSubtitle` call in `createSimpleKPITile`
* Confirmed previous call would have written to `startRow+3`

#### 2. DailyDash_New [LayoutUtils].js Modified (Further Refinement)

##### formatKpiValueWithChange function

* Added explicit cell clearing:
  * `clearContent().clearDataValidations().clearNote()` for main value and secondary info cells
  * Secondary info cell (`row, column + 1`) cleared for non-"Average Rating"/"5-Star Ratings" tiles
  * Change indicator cell note cleared for non-"% Negative Cases" tiles
* Updated vertical alignment from "bottom" to "middle" for secondary info text
* Verified merge/unmerge logic for change indicator cell (`startRow + 2, column, 1, 2`)

These refinements aim to improve 3-row rendering robustness through explicit cell state management.
